                <p>News in Africa is distributed, not organized, feeds do not follow standards, and a majority of news sites rely on ad money. Stories are mostly politics or sports, with a few lifestyle and tech ones sharing a thing or two.</p>
                <p>I am addicted to information, especially tech and science news. I built a few apps that would grab news from different sites and display them according to date. But the apps were only worked on localhost.</p>
                <p>In 2017, i decided to push it mainstream and build a system that would aggregate news and information from all over the continent. Currently this is the first of the many designs i have come up with. The main goal of this design is discovery of content and easy consumption of information.</p>
                <p>Main function of the mobile design is ease of use and navigation.</p>
